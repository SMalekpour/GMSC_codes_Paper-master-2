This repository contains the codes used in our GMSC paper for comparing different definitions of generalized magnitude-squared coherence. This code compares different measures of GMSC that was presented in our paper, i.e., "Measures of Generalized Magnitude-Squared Coherence:Differences and Similarities" by Sheida Malekpour, John A. Gubner, and William A. Sethares. It has been submitted to a Journal for possible publication.
